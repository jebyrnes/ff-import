Wand requires v6.x of ImageMagick.

This can be installed on a mac by doing:

$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install imagemagick@6 --with-hdri --with-quantum-32

You will need to add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/bin:$PATH"
export MAGICK_HOME=/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6

Unfortunately, v6.x of ImageMagick does not handle the signed 16bit values
in the geotiffs correctly. This means that we get a lot of bad noise on
our images from sensor values between -2000 and 0, which are corrected for
properly by our use of the PLM script.
